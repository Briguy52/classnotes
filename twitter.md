# How to get the Tech Job - Yuzhou 

Student --> Blackbox --> Industry

> What happens in the black box?

Q1: how do you get your 'first big break'?

Q2: how do you choose the 'right' job?

> interviewing is not a one-way street, is what's important to them what's important to you?

## Q1 - Skills/Opportunities/People

### Skills

> It is ok to not know what you are 'truly' interested in

Lesson: you just need to be REAL good (or even just better than average) at ONE thing

(for me- frontend web dev)

#### Hardskills
> books, tutorials, websites, project euler

#### Softskills
> communication is KEY - 'communicating fearlessly to build trust'

> thought leaders - reading (have an opinion is really important in the long run)

check out recode/domain expert websites 

#### You need to pay your dues

* this is a technical skill - you need to spend time working on it
* you can't network yourself into a job w/o the skills
* social time vs 'training' time

#### How do you become [insert role here]?
> the best way to do it, is to do it (ie projects)

> learning in your own time/in groups

#### SWE

> do some lynda (expensive but free to Duke)

> cs193p from stanford

read read read read read - sad but true

#### 2 project starter questions
* I want to build x so I will learn [this tech]
* I want to learn [this tech] so I will build it

take classes that interest you, grades matter less than what you learn

a lot can be learnt from education sites (coursera, edx)

### Attitudes * 

(most important)

#### passion

find out why you are really interested in it
> self awareness + intentionality

#### people
the way you treat people is very important

when seeking mentors, do not see people as resources/opportunities

when working with peers, learn how to work with different types of people

#### giving back to the community
seek out people with the same interests (both more/less experienced)

reach out and offer to mentor/teach people
> the karma will come back to you

### meeting the people
> you are the average of the 5 people you spend most time with

#### where to meet people

"hey where do you want to grab coffee some time?"

lesson: good people tend to introduce good people ie network effect

opportunity to make change and grow the community
