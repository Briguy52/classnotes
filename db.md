### e/r model: review

entity sets

* keys
* weak entity sets

relationship sets
* attributes on relationships
* multiplicity
* roles
* binary versus n-ary relationships
* isa relationships (kinda like oo)

### how translate e/r to relational table?

1. attributes = columns
2. key attributes = key columns

weak entity sets are more complicated (b/c they borrow key attributes and this can lead to conflicts)
