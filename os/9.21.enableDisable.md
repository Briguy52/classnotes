#### How do threads get switched out? (2 ways)
1. interrupts (hardware external events)
2. yields, I/O request (internal events)

Easy to prevent internal events, use disable/enable to prevent external events

#### Why is it ok for lock code to disable interrupts?

It is trusted code- can disable interrupts. (User code is untrusted code)

Lock code is 'part of the government'

#### Do we need to disable interrupts in unlock?

```
unlock () {
  disable interrupts
  value = FREE
  enable interrupts
}
```

It's possible that we set the value to FREE and get stuck

#### Why enable-disable in lock loop body?

Don't want thread that owns the lock to be interrupted! (else other threads will never be able to acquire the lock)
